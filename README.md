# Spin-The-Spectrum
Code for Good Web Application

Disclaimer: DO NOT CLONE/COPY THIS CODE.

I worked on this project as a part of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Code For Good within a team of 6 members.
It is intended to help the instructors at Spin the Spectrum with predicting and alleviating any tension 
or shifts in mood during their DJ sessions. The front end was built using React.js and CSS, and the 
endpoints were connected between the front and back end using Axios. The back end utilized Express.js, 
Node.js, MongoDB, and Postman to store the information taken in during check-in for each session as well 
as regularly monitor heartbeat data that are collected during a session. The website features a 
questionnaire that allows parents and instructors to collectively fill out the student's information in 
addition to establishing a baseline heartbeat for the remainder of the session. If a student experiences 
a major diversion from their resting heart rate, they are immediately pushed an alert, asking if they are 
feeling okay. If they aren't, the alert progresses to other statements, assessing the current situation. 
Instructors are given a portal to view information pertaining to each student's feeling sensitivities and 
favorite activities.
